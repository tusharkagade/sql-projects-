# ✈️ **Airline Flight Delay Analysis – MySQL Case Study**

---

**🚀 Project Objective**

The objective of this project was to analyze airline flight delays using MySQL. The aim was to discover patterns in delays, cancellations, 
and operational inefficiencies to help airlines improve on-time performance, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

---

**🗄️ Data Overview**

The analysis uses a table called `airline_delay` with fields such as:

- `carrier_name` → Airline name
- `airport_name` → Airport name
- `year`, `month` → Date attributes
- `arr_flights` → Total arriving flights
- `arr_del15` → Flights delayed more than 15 minutes
- `carrier_delay` → Delay minutes due to airline operations
- `weather_delay` → Delay minutes due to weather
- `nas_delay` → Delay minutes due to National Airspace System issues
- `security_delay` → Delay minutes due to security checks
- `late_aircraft_delay` → Delay minutes due to late arriving aircraft
- `arr_cancelled` → Cancelled flights

**🛠️ Tools Used**

- **MySQL** for data extraction and analysis
- SQL techniques:
  - Grouping and aggregations
  - Window functions
  - CTEs for complex logic (if needed)

💡 Key Insights

- Certain airlines show significantly higher delay percentages, suggesting operational inefficiencies.

- Some airports consistently experience higher delays, indicating possible bottlenecks.

- Summer months tend to have increased delays, potentially due to higher passenger volume or weather factors.

- Late aircraft connections are a major cause of cascading delays.

🏆 Business Value Delivered

-- Helps airlines target operational improvements.

-- Allows airports to allocate resources more effectively.

-- Supports regulatory and strategic decisions in the aviation industry.

-- Contributes to improving customer satisfaction by addressing delay root causes.
